<h2 class="secondH">Welcome to SEFM 2021</h2>
<p>The 19th edition of the International Conference on Software Engineering and
 Formal Methods will <br>be held between 6 and 10 December 2021.</p>

<p>The conference aims to bring together researchers and practitioners from academia,
 industry and government, to advance the state of the art in formal methods,
 to facilitate their uptake in the software industry, and to encourage their
 integration within practical software engineering methods and tools.</p>

<h3>SEFM 2021 will be an entirely virtual event</h3>

<p>Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have decided that SEFM 2021 will not take
place physically but will be replaced by a virtual event.</p>

<h3>Conference proceedings</h3>

<p>As usual, the SEFM conference proceedings will be published in Springer's Lecture
Notes in Computer Science series. All accepted papers will have to be presented
at the virtual conference.</p>
